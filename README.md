# TODO
Your work life has "sessions", ranging in both moods & nature, and times & places. Use this repo how you'd like to get things done.

# My Workflow (Create Your Own)
**Step 1:** Create a TODO list. Add anything that you want to remember todo in the future, big and small.
  - No need to be overly specific, some things are more defined than others.
  - This should be editing this todo list locally on your computer, not on the internet. This helps when you're offline, and also will keep your focus "out of the browser".
  - Keep it synced between devices using this git repo.
  - Example:
    ```
    # TODO
    - [ ] create tracking issue for "important thing"
    - [ ] publish thing
    - [ ] work on: ongoing thing
    - [ ] work on: 1-off thing
    - [ ] emails
    - [ ] DMs
    - [ ] chats
    ```  

**Step 3:** Before you start your next "session", ***put the items you would like to complete today at the top.***
  - I like doing this in a new section called ***ASAP***.
  - It's okay if you go too large at first, ambition is a good thing, and some days are better than others.
  - Example:
    ```
    # ASAP
    - [ ] create tracking issue for "important thing"
    - [ ] work on: 1-off thing
    - [ ] emails
    - [ ] DMs

    # TODO
    - [ ] ...
    ```

**Step 4:** Have a wonderful day! Come back to this list whenever you feel the need to.
  - As you complete things, feel the joy of checking them off, you did it.
  - add/remove/modify this list to your hearts content.

**Step 5:** When you're done working for the session (hour(s), day(s), etc), move everything back into the ***TODO*** section.

**Rinse & Repeat**
